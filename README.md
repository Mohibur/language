# A simple tool to extract JSON data
  
  1 I called it language, because I have developed this as helper for treefrog. Mainly this tool will support developer to generate multilanguage support from a single file
  2 We can also extract file json data using extract command


Feature
--------
* Easy to use


Requirements
------------
* Linux <- I have not tested anywehere else yet
* Qt toolkit version >= 5.2
* C++11 Compiler
* Make tool

On Linux, you can install by 'apt-get' or 'yum'. Case of Ubuntu:
Install Qt libraries and dev tools.

Since this is developed to work with treefrog, I am expecting all the available tools are already there

```
  $ sudo apt-get install -y qt5-default qt5-qmake libqt5core5a libqt5qml5 libqt5xml5 qtbase5-dev qtdeclarative5-dev qtbase5-dev-tools gcc g++ make
```
